# I2C Light Monitoring System using ESP8266 and LDR

This project is a simple yet effective light monitoring system built using an **ESP8266**, **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)**, and an **I2C-based 16x2 LCD display**. It reads the ambient light intensity and displays whether the environment is **BRIGHT** or **DARK** on the LCD screen. It's ideal for smart environment sensing, home automation, or educational purposes.

## üóÇÔ∏è Circuit Diagram

- **LDR Setup**: Connect one end of the LDR to **3.3V**, and the other end to **A0** and a **10k resistor to GND**.
- **I2C LCD**:  
  - `SDA` ‚Üí `D2` (GPIO4)  
  - `SCL` ‚Üí `D1` (GPIO5)  
  - `VCC` ‚Üí `3.3V`  
  - `GND` ‚Üí `GND`

## üíª Code Overview

- Reads analog light intensity from `A0`
- Compares the value against a threshold
- Displays "BRIGHT" or "DARK" on the I2C LCD
- Also displays the raw LDR value (optional)
